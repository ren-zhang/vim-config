# This is my VIM config

This repo contains the contents of my .vim folder. 

I use the following plugins:

* [delimitMate](https://github.com/Raimondi/delimitMate)
* [emmet-vim](https://github.com/mattn/emmet-vim)
* [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic)
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)
* [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex)

These packages are managed using [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

They should be installed under the `/bundle` directory.
